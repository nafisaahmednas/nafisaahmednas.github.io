                            Immunocompromised and ICU-admitted patients are at higher risk for bacterial and fungal infections, including COVID-19-associated candidiasis, which is increasingly recognized as a severe COVID-19 complication. This review explores the virulence of Candida spp. and the molecular pathogenesis. We analyze the predisposing factors that make COVID-19 patients more susceptible to candidiasis and the preventive measures which will provide valuable insights to guide the effective prevention of candidiasis in COVID-19 patients. We discuss preventive measures to combat candidiasis in COVID-19 patients, highlighting the importance of understanding these factors and their interactions to prevent opportunistic co-infections that reduce survival chances.

                            As the global COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact the world, areas where dengue is prevalent face the potential for a concurrent outbreak of COVID-19 and dengue coinfection. COVID-19 and dengue share clinical symptoms and laboratory features, making differentiation difficult, especially in dengue-endemic regions, which is a major health concern as it increases the risk of misdiagnosis and creates challenges as the management of the two diseases is completely different. The case reported shows a 38-year-old male patient who had a COVID-19 and dengue coinfection, illustrating the existence of coinfections in the Philippines, demonstrating the difficulty in distinguishing the two infections and the need for proper diagnosis, prevention, and management measures.

                            The sudden spread of mucormycosis in COVID-19 patients engendered massive concern worldwide. Studies have shown that fungi rely on the FTR1 gene-encoded ferrous permease to obtain iron from the host. Thus, in this study, the FTR1 protein has been targeted to design a convenient and novel epitope-based vaccine with the help of immunoinformatics against four different virulent fungal species. The designed vaccine will be a potential therapeutic not only to control mucormycosis in COVID-19 patients but also be effective in general mucormycosis events. However, further in vitro, and in vivo testing is needed to confirm the vaccine’s safety and efficacy in controlling fungal infections.

                            Milciclib is a potential candidate for Hepatocellular carcinoma which exhibits inhibitory activity against CDK2 leading to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis of tumor cells. The parent drug milciclib (D) can be halogenated with the F, Cl, and CF3 groups using bioinformatics techniques. Modified derivatives exhibited way stronger interaction against CDK2 in molecular docking analyses than the parent drug as well as exhibit better stability and higher binding affinity than others. The derivatives have better pharmacokinetic properties compared to the parent drug which reveal their potentiality

                            COVID-19 pandemic caused vitamin D deficiency in many people by a direct effect of home quarantine in the affected countries. With vitamin D levels gravely decreased by reduced movement and activity, a number of possible negative outcomes are expected in COVID-19 patients, pregnant women and children during this ongoing pandemic. Vitamin D has a direct inhibitory effect on post infection through a number of mechanisms that promises to make vitamin D a future adjunctive therapy for COVID-19 treatment. Besides, clinical evidence also supports its role in preventing pregnancy complications and improving pregnancy outcomes. Consistent with the manifold role of vitamin D, an increasing number of studies suggest its role in improving the mental health of children who have been adversely affected throughout this pandemic. This review article discusses the potential roles of vitamin D on COVID-19 patients, pregnant women and children focusing its scope to become a supplementary candidate for these vulnerable groups to combat the ongoing pandemic.

                            In this study, the immunoinformatics approach was utilized to design a potential polyvalent epitope-based vaccine effective against the four virulent strains of human cytomegalovirus. The vaccine was designed with specific T-cell and B-cell epitopes that were predicted to be antigenic, non-allergenic, non-toxic, fully conserved, and non-human homologous. Subsequently, molecular docking study, protein-protein interaction analysis, molecular dynamics simulation, and immune simulation study rendered promising results assuring the vaccine to be stable, safe, and effective.

                            Epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) is a transmembrane glycoprotein which is integral for the proper development of cells and tissues. Cleavage of the EpCAM protein leads to the up-regulation of c-myc, e-fabp, and cyclins A and E which promote tumorigenesis. EpCAM can act as potential diagnostic and prognostic biomarker for different types of cancers as it is also found to be expressed in epithelia and epithelial-derived neoplasms. Hence, we aimed to analyze the EpCAM gene expression of two major types of lung cancer (LC) i.e., lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC). Our in-silico study suggests EpCAM to be a significant biomarker for human LC prognosis.

                            Alzheimer’s disease predominantly results from genetic heritability, age, and abnormal deposition of proteins, such as amyloid β, inside as well as outside of brain cells. Amyloid β is generated by the proteolytic activity of the β-secretase enzyme, making β-secretase a prime drug target for the inhibition of amyloid β production. In this study, 40 plant-derived phytocompounds, proven to have β-secretase inhibitory activity in different laboratory experiments, were evaluated using computational approaches in order to identify the best possible β-secretase inhibitor(s). Results showed promising results Amentoflavone, Biolbetin, and Ellagic acid in different drug potential assessment experiments and displayed signs of correlation with significant pharmacological and biological activities.
